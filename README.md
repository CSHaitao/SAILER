# SAILER: Structure-aware Pre-trained Language Model for Legal Case Retrieval

The official repo for our SIGIR'23 Full paper: [SAILER: Structure-aware Pre-trained Language Model for Legal Case Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11370). 

## Introduction

SAILER is a structure-aware pre-trained language model. It is highlighted in the following three aspects: 

- SAILER fully utilizes the structural information contained in legal case documents and pays more attention to key legal elements, similar to how legal experts browse legal case documents. 

- SAILER employs an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to integrate several different pre-training objectives. In this way, rich semantic information across tasks is encoded into dense vectors. 

- SAILER has powerful discriminative ability, even without any legal annotation data. It can distinguish legal cases with different charges accurately.
